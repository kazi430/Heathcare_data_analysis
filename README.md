# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

Welcome to my Power BI project focused on analyzing healthcare data to uncover key insights about patient visits, demographics, and hospital stay durations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves developing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** based on hospital visit data. The goal is to extract actionable insights that could support better decision-making in the healthcare sector.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Measure and visualize hospital **visit frequency** and **stay duration**
- Compare behavior of **solo vs accompanied** patients
- Track **repeat visits** and identify visit patterns
- Generate visual trends to aid hospital management

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Data Modeling
- Slicers & Filters
- Interactive Visuals and KPIs

---

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard

- Dynamic visuals with slicers for **date**, **gender**, and **age group**
- Key performance indicators:
  - Average Stay Duration
  - Repeat Visitor Count
  - Visits by Gender
  - Stay Pattern (Solo vs Accompanied)
- Clear and clean visual storytelling using cards, bar charts, and line graphs
- Insights panel with observation-based interpretations

---

## 🔍 Insights Discovered

- Solo patients tend to stay **shorter durations** than accompanied ones.
- **Repeat patients** often return within a certain time range.
- Gender and age have significant effects on hospital usage patterns.
